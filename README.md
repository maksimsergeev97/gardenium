# Website for the investment company Gardenium

You can view the website by following the link - [**Gardenium**](https://maksimsergeev97.github.io/gardenium)

There is no active user interaction on the site, so it was decided to write the functionality in vanilla JavaScript without using libraries. 

GSAP library was chosen for animations, and Chart.js library for creating trading charts. 

A custom cursor has also been created, and block scrolling has been configured for the desktop version of the site.

**Technologies used:**
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* SCSS
* GSAP - library for animations
* Chart.js - library for creating charts
